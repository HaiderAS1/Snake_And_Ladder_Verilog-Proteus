# Snake_And_Ladder_Verilog-Proteus
In this project, digital electronics concepts are used to simulate 4x4 Snake Ladder game. Like real life Snake Ladder games, User will roll a dice first and user's position will move according to dice value. However, There is one trap position in the matrix, reaching here will make user go back to initial position.
The implementations are carried out both in Proteus with digital electronic circuits and chips as well as in verilog using HDL to have FPGA synthesis.

Please Read the PDF file associated to understand the implementation. ( proj__1606134_139_140.pdf )
